### Description

This is a game I wrote awhile back called DragonQuest. You basically are trying to fight your way to the top and become strong enough to defeat the dragon. Along the way you will visit: your home, weapon/armor/item shop, the trainer to advance your training, the forest to fight monsters and gain experience/gold and to search for the ever ellusive dragon. It uses SQL and all VB coding with an Access database. I know the graphics are horrible so please don't flame me over them. I commented where I could but there is a lot of repetitive code. All battles are performed with a dice-rolling competition (learn how to do random dice rolls and show the correct dice). If the players roll is higher than or equal to the monsters, he/she wins the attack. I hope someone learns something from this. Please comment and vote. I am thinking about upgrading this with DirectX and sounds but I don't know. I guess I'll see what kind of response I get here.

Thank You
